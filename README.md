# Machine_Learning_Project
A project of ML for predicting price in Real Estates.
REAL ESTATES: Real estate is real property that consists of land and improvements, which include buildings, fixtures, roads, structures, and utility systems. 
Using this model, we try to predict price of houses for an imaginary Real Estate Company.

# MAIN POINTS
* Using Supervised learning (since we have features and labels).
* This is a regression task (since we are getting a value).
* This is based on Batch learning technique (since we already have data and need to create a one-time model).
* Selecting Performance measure: Root Mean Square error (rmse).

--> used dataset from UCI.
--> tried three models in this project ( Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression )
